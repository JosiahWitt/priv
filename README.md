**Under development; API may change.**

## About

Currently `priv` exports a simple API, which is composed of `priv.ToMap` and `priv.ToMapErr`. `priv.ToMap` panics if a field that does not exist is requested, whereas `priv.ToMapErr` returns an error. Most of the time panicing is not a big deal, since it would indicate a typo in the code.

These functions allow mapping structs and arrays/slices of structs to `map[string]interface{}` and `[]map[string]interface{}{}`, respectively.
One example of using `priv` is if you only want to expose certain fields at an API endpoint.

## Example

```go
users := [User{ID: "123", Some: {Nested: {Field: "abc"}}, SomethingElse: true}]
v := priv.ToMap(users, "ID", "Some.Nested.Field->Renamed.Location")
// Thus, v = [{ID: "123", Renamed: {Location: "abc"}}]
```
